This was an assignment that required us to create an ordered linked list consisted of ints. An ordered linked list will sort items that are added to the list. 

For example, if the user is entering 8,1,0 the linked list would be arranged so that it is 
0->1->8

The assignment also required that the program tell the user how many nodes contain even and odd integers. 

The program would also have to average all of the numbers in the ordered linked list
