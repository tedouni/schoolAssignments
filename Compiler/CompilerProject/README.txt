********IMPORTANT***********

Unfortunately this project wasn't  done correctly upon submission. We forgot to check for compile errors that the Predictive Parsing Table would not have caught (just because a WORD is accepted by the GRAMMAR of a LANGUAGE doesn't mean that it will meet the requirements of this project)

Also the translate function was programmed for the given finalv1.txt. 

Both mistakes were easy to correct/fix.


1) Program will reformat finalv1.txt into a readable format as finalv2.txt
2) Program will then check to see if the Syntax of finalv2.txt is suitable for compiler. In this case it just checks to make sure that the WORD (finalv2.txt) is accepted by the GRAMMAR of the given LANGUAGE (supplied by professor). 
3) If syntax is accepted then the program will translate into C++ (this part was written for this particular given text file due to the assumption that WRITE ( variable ) would be followed by END. )
